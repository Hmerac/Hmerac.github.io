This Python script will show the events happened on the day the script is run. Take a look!
As a side note, this is just the first version. I&amp;rsquo;m counting on my self-motivation and the community on improving this. I hope you find it entertaining and informative!
I&amp;rsquo;m fetching the events from history.</description></item><item><title>A Milestone</title><link>https://mertacikportali.com/blog/2020/a-milestone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mertacikportali.com/blog/2020/a-milestone/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/2020/skyline.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hello people!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long long time since we were together and there are reasons for that. I&amp;rsquo;d like to give you some updates about myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="1">#1&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Where to start&amp;hellip; Okay. On October, I felt like I needed to take AWS Solutions Architect &amp;ndash; Professional certificate. Well, at least some sort of certificate which verifies my cloud knowledge. I studied for two straight months and wasn&amp;rsquo;t even ready on the exam day. You can check my notes here: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;a href="https://github.com/Hmerac/AWSCSAProNotes">https://github.com/Hmerac/AWSCSAProNotes&lt;/a>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway(somehow!?) I passed the exam and got my certificate. It felt amazing for two days but then the feeling of triumph slowly faded away because I have one more certificate goal which is CKA. I&amp;rsquo;ll take it some time later, but not now. This was the first reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="2">#2&lt;/h1></description></item><item><title>Snapshot Restore versus pg_restore â€“ Time Comparison</title><link>https://mertacikportali.com/blog/2019/snapshot-restore-pg-restore/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mertacikportali.com/blog/2019/snapshot-restore-pg-restore/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll just cut to the chase here and give detailed analysis immediately after.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The time difference between &lt;strong>pg_restoring&lt;/strong> an &lt;strong>11GB&lt;/strong> sized PostgreSQL database with &lt;strong>159MB pg_dump&lt;/strong> file, versus &lt;strong>restoring snapshot&lt;/strong> of itsÂ &lt;strong>t2.medium&lt;/strong> RDS Instance:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/2019/time_table-1.png" alt="image">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="analysis">Analysis&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Important note! The time values are subject to change, because it depends on network, other running processes, intermediary EC2 Instance type etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="pg_restore">pg_restore&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I used a &lt;strong>t2.medium&lt;/strong> SSM Bastion Instance to execute PostgreSQL commands. As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, provisioning a more powerful EC2 Instance might increase the performance drastically. You can find information about SSM Bastions in &lt;a href="https://www.mertacikportali.com/blog/2019/session-manager-modern-bastion">this page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Imagine you have a PostgreSQL database named &amp;ldquo;XXX&amp;rdquo;; with &lt;strong>11 GB size&lt;/strong>. Don&amp;rsquo;t get distracted with the name, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I named it &amp;ldquo;XXX&amp;rdquo;; at the first hand, but here we go anyway ðŸ™‚&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Session Manager - Modern Bastion</title><link>https://mertacikportali.com/blog/2019/session-manager-modern-bastion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mertacikportali.com/blog/2019/session-manager-modern-bastion/</guid><description>Overview Are you tired of dealing with key pairs? Maybe tired of securing them with KeyPass? Or configuring SSH daemon for ease of use? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, Systems Manager - Session Manager is here to save you from all these.
Session Manager is announced on 11 September 2018 with this here. Seriously, I remember being excited like potatoes thrown into hot oil. Because the process for connecting RDS Instances via Bastion Hosts were literal pain in our workplace.</description></item></channel></rss>
