Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description></item><item><title>histoday</title><link>https://mertacikportali.com/blog/histoday/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mertacikportali.com/blog/histoday/</guid><description>I had an idea which I wanted to bring to life and apparently, this week is THE week!
This Python script will show the events happened on the day the script is run. Take a look!
As a side note, this is just the first version. I&amp;rsquo;m counting on my self-motivation and the community on improving this. I hope you find it entertaining and informative!
I';m fetching the events from history.</description></item></channel></rss>
