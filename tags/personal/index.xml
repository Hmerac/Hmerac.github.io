This Python script will show the events happened on the day the script is run. Take a look!
As a side note, this is just the first version. I&amp;rsquo;m counting on my self-motivation and the community on improving this. I hope you find it entertaining and informative!
I&amp;rsquo;m fetching the events from history.</description></item><item><title>A Milestone</title><link>https://mertacikportali.com/blog/2020/a-milestone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mertacikportali.com/blog/2020/a-milestone/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="img/2020/skyline.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hello people!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long long time since we were together and there are reasons for that. I&amp;rsquo;d like to give you some updates about myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="1">#1&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Where to start&amp;hellip; Okay. On October, I felt like I needed to take AWS Solutions Architect &amp;ndash; Professional certificate. Well, at least some sort of certificate which verifies my cloud knowledge. I studied for two straight months and wasn&amp;rsquo;t even ready on the exam day. You can check my notes here: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;a href="https://github.com/Hmerac/AWSCSAProNotes">https://github.com/Hmerac/AWSCSAProNotes&lt;/a>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway(somehow!?) I passed the exam and got my certificate. It felt amazing for two days but then the feeling of triumph slowly faded away because I have one more certificate goal which is CKA. I&amp;rsquo;ll take it some time later, but not now. This was the first reason.&lt;/p>
